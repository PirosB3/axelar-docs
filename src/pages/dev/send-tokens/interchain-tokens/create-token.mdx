# Create a new Interchain Token

Interchain Tokens are ERC-20 tokens that are available on multiple blockchains. They are created using the [Interchain Token Service](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interchain-token-service/InterchainTokenService.sol) and can be used to transfer value between blockchains. Interchain Tokens are either [standardized](../../reference/glossary/#standardized) or [custom](../../reference/glossary/#custom).

To clarify how this system works, we'll explore two ways to create new Interchain Tokens.

## Create a new Interchain Token(s) using the Interchain Token Portal

The simplest type of Interchain Token is to create a brand new [standardized](../../reference/glossary/#standardized) ERC-20 available on multiple chains. [Here is a step-by-step tutorial for creating an Interchain Token using the Interchain Token Portal in 4 steps](https://axelar.network/blog/how-to-create-an-interchain-token-with-axelar-in-4-steps).

- Visit the [Interchain Portal](https://testnet.interchain.axelar.dev)
- Connect your wallet to the portal
- Select a source network where you have funds available
- Choose the option to deploy a new ERC-20 token
- Specify the initial supply for your new token
	- You can also choose the advanced option to enable later minting of additional tokens
- Select any additional chains where you want your new token to be available


**Congratulations!** You now have an ERC-20 token available on multiple chains. You can interact with your token on any chain identically, as they are all ERC-20 tokens. You can send, transfer, approve, and use all of the methods you are used to. 

Additionally, each of these tokens is a [Standardized Interchain Token](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IStandardizedToken.sol) and has an [`interchainTransfer`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainToken.sol#L20) method allowing you to transfer it between blockchains.

Here is an example of using the `interchainTransfer` method.

```solidity
function interchainTransfer(
	string calldata destinationChain,
	bytes calldata recipient,
	uint256 amount,
	bytes calldata metadata
) external payable;
```

## Create a new custom Interchain Token(s)

If you want more features than the [standardized](../../reference/glossary/#standardized) token provides, you can create a [custom](../../reference/glossary/#custom) token. You may want a customized token to customize minting policies, ensure ownership or control of the token by a DAO, create rate limits, or build any other custom logic into your token.

- Build your [ERC-20 token](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-create-an-erc-20-token-4-steps) and deploy it on multiple chains

- Deploy a [Mint/Burn](../../reference/glossary/#mintburn) - [Token Manager](../../reference/glossary/#token-manager) contract for each chain by calling `deployCustomTokenManager` (or `deployRemoteCustomTokenManager` for remote chains) on the Interchain Token Service

- Set the [distributor](../../reference/glossary/#distributor-role) role on your token contract as the new Token Manager contract on each chain. This will give the Token Manager permission to mint and burn tokens on your behalf.

Tokens can move between chains seamlessly as the Token Manager contracts will mint and burn tokens as needed.

Here is an example of deploying your own Token Manager.

```solidity
function deployTokenManager(bytes32 salt) external {
	bytes memory params = service.getParamsMintBurn(address(this).toBytes(), tokenAddress);
	bytes32 tokenId = service.deployCustomTokenManager(salt, TokenManagerType.MINT_BURN, params);
	address tokenManager = service.getTokenManagerAddress(tokenId);
	CustomERC20(tokenAddress).setDistributor(tokenManager);
}
```

>**Note**: If you want to build your token with the `IInterchainToken` feature yourself, make sure your token implements the [`IInterchainToken`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainToken.sol) interface so you can offer [`interchainTransfer`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainToken.sol#L20) and [`interchainTransferFrom`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainToken.sol#L37) methods directly on your token. 

You can try our [sample custom token](https://remix.ethereum.org/axelarnetwork/axelar-docs/blob/main/public/samples/interchain-token-iinterchaintoken.sol) as a starting point. This token self-registers with the Interchain Token Service and can be deployed to multiple chains. 
Once you have designed your token, you can deploy it to multiple chains using a tool such as the [Constant Address Deployer](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/solidity-utilities#constant-address-deployer) to give it the same address everywhere.
